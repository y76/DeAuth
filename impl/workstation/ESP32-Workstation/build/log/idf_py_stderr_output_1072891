CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/pavel/apps/DeAuth/impl/workstation/ESP32-Workstation/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/pavel/apps/LOC-PAISA/1_IoTDev/3_ESP32-C3_user_device/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/pavel/apps/DeAuth/impl/workstation/ESP32-Workstation/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/pavel/apps/LOC-PAISA/1_IoTDev/3_ESP32-C3_user_device/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
